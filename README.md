Background: At [EduGorilla Directory Listing](https://directory.edugorilla.com) Portal, we receive 50+ queries every day. We have more than 40,000 Coaching centers, which are increasing at a rate of 1 Institute per 40secs, listed on our website.

We have to come with a transparent platform of all the leads on our website. There are two aspects of this project:

1. 1)Promotional Lead: These leads will be forwarded to all the people in that category
